# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

  The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of a PyBer(ride-sharing app company) data to create different types of a visualizations to tell a compelling story about the connections between city, riders, and fares. As a data analyst we are here to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


## Results

  After creating the summary DataFrame, we can see the increased demand in urban cities which creates increase of drivers and fares. However, in rural cities increased fare per driver due to distance between destinations. Also, since in larger cities have higher demand than rural cities so total fares and total rides have direct relationship.

Relationship between total rides, total drivers, total fares, average per ride and average fare per driver

       •	Urban cities have the most volume of drivers, rides and total fares.
       •	Rural cities have the least total fares, however average fare per driver is the highest due to its distance between               destinations.
       •	Urban cities total drivers are higher than its demand which clearly can create decrease of income per driver. 

       

## Summary

### Recommendations

1. In order to increase the drivers income in urban area, PyBer needs to increase the per mile fare, since destinations are clearly shorter than rural cities.
2. Due to higher demand in urban cities, PyBer company could reduce the budget in marketing department. On the other hand, in rural cities could increase the marketing which can attract more customer.
3. Lastly but not limited to, using an extra ride scheduling in sparse area so drivers can serve more than one customer at a time.
